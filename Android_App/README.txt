The project was created in Android Studio v3.2

To compile and run the app, I'd recommend importing the project into Android Studio using 
the build.gradle file included in the zip. After downloading the project, extract it and 
save it to its own directory. Then, inside Android Studio, select the option to import
a project, then locate the build.gradle file located in the top level of the now unzipped
project directory. The project should then be able to be run on an android device connected
to the computer (you will have to turn on usb debugging on the phone).

Once the project is created and compiled, the device will need to be connected to the 
wifi network created by the server. This is a temporary solution since the bracelet 
and app are not currently able to find the server unless it's connected to the specific
network.
