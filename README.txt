This repository contains all the design files for the E45 project "Vibration Alert Bracelet (VAB)".
The bracelet design has two basic functions: 
1) Receive a wireless signal from a main control center and respond with a vibration to alert the person wearing the bracelet about emergencies, and 
2) Generate an emergency signal by pressing a button that is sent from the bracelet to the control center.
